# Centralized Cooperative Exploration Policy for Continuous Control Tasks

PyTorch implementation of Centralized Cooperative Exploration Policy(CCEP). This method is tested on [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org) continuous control tasks in [OpenAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym). 

This code is developed with python 3.7 and the networks are trained using [PyTorch 1.10.2](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch). The version of [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org) is 2.1.2.
 
## Installation
```Python
pip3 install -U 'mujoco-py<2.2,>=2.1'
```
## Usage

Experiments on single environments can be run by calling:
